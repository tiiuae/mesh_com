# Field test log player

Field test log player is used to replay recorded Node log file.

## Installation

### Create virtual environment

Run following commands in field_test_log_player directory to create and activate virtual
environment.
```
$ python3 -m venv ./venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### Install required packages
Install packages listed in requirements.txt into virtual environment.
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create animated graph from all the logs in specified directory:
```
$ python3 ftl_player.py -p ~/logs/mesh_test
```
Control options:
```
    -p: Path to folder which includes field_test_logger CSV log files from one specific test run.
        Folder should include one log file from each Node DUT.
    -m: MAC address of a moving node.  This option will add trace from old node positions (optional)
    -i: Enable this in indoor environment, when GPS use is not possible.  Nodes are plotted to the
        circumference of the circle and timestamps are taken from system time instead of GSP time.
    -a: active path tracking between given MAC addresses (optional)
    -t  rx/tx kbit/s values from each node.
```
Create animated graph from all the logs in specified directory and add trace from moving node:
```
$ python3 ftl_player.py -p ~/logs/mesh_test -m 11:22:33:44:55:66
```
Indoor example with active path tracking:
```
$ python3 ftl_player.py -p ~/logs/mesh_test -i -a 11:22:33:44:55:66,11:22:33:44:55:77
```
Active keys in plotter view:

    spacebar    - pause/resume, zooming possible during pause
    +           - skip next 30seconds in log file
